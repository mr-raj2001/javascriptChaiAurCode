js 
synchronous he aur single threaded

Execution Context

execute one line of code at a time

js engine akele bahut slowly par woh kahi be akele nahi milega woh hamesa ek runtime enviorment milega



console.log 1
console.log 2

call stack memory heap

Blocking code non blocking code

blocking code = read file sync 
non-blocking code = read file async

file read karne ke liye execution access kernel ko diya jata he phir wapas program diya jata he 


async task batane ke liye yeh hamare pas yeh sab api hoti he 


in diagram take for example print 1 setTimeout(0,print 2 ),print 3 ab 2 will be printed after 3 event if its timeout is 0 kyuki woh fucntion he toh register call back se hoke queue se hoke stack me jayega to execute 
fetch is something which has promise so it has a priority queue .


Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution. Whenever an object is created, it's always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it.



//api request


there are 5 states in xml

0 unsent
1 openend 
2 readers recived
3 loading 
4 done


the promise objecy represents the eventual completion or failure of an async operations and its resulting value 

promise has three state :
pending 
fulffiled
rejected


yeh 404 400 yeh sab errors yeh response me ayega yeh reject me nahi ayega browser ka nahi pata yeh sab ke bare me browser just knows woh nahi chala toh error 
matlab woh request kar hi nahi paya he 


fetch ke liye ek special micro task queue ya priority queue banti he 

diagram 6:36 in 
fetch do hisso me baghta he 1st hota he variables ke liye space ocupy karne ke liye aur dusra bgahta he browser me api request ke liye 


jo data :-
onfulfilled[]
onRejection[]  fields he woh private ap usko access nahi kar sakte ho


woh data he woh network request fire karta he phir jake onfulfilled ya onrejection me jakeyga

chaiye woh 404 bhi gaya woh fulfilled hi he .network reuest nahi hona onrejection me ata he woh hua isiliye 404 aya he 


phir yeh onfulfiled on response data ko fulfill karta he
